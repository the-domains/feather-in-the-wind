★ IDIOSYNCRATIC CREDO: Believe in the romantic. Learn of the mystic, the poetic, the artistic, the ecstatic. Live the fantastic. ★ 

My passions in life are traveling the world, practicing Kung-Fu, learning new languages, reading & haute couture. I study dictionaries and cookbooks for fun and I can actually taste the difference between good wines and the mediocre--- and not just be a snob about them. I spend about a month in Mykonos each summer & I try to travel to at least one other exotic destination every year. I love Paris (& Joel Robuchon) and I miss Venice, madly.
