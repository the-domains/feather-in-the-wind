ABOUT ME ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9caeb9ea-70f4-47ac-b1ad-54d51babe674.jpg)

_"I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world"._

Silia J. Hatzi, lusus naturae.

Sport: Billiards

Arts: Martial

Book: Dictionary

★ Idiosyncratic credo: Believe in the romantic. Learn of the mystic, the poetic, the artistic, the ecstatic. Live the fantastic. ★ 

My passions in life are traveling the world, practicing Kung-Fu, learning new languages, reading & haute couture. I study dictionaries and cookbooks for fun and I can actually taste the difference between good wines and the mediocre---and not just be a snob about them. I spend about a month in Mykonos each summer & I try to travel to at least one other exotic destination every year. I love Paris (& Joel Robuchon) and I miss Venice, madly. 

I have not owned a television in almost two decades and a majority of my favourite people in the world are dead---some for several thousands of years now. Some have lived on Papyrus continents alone. The which does not preclude me from wanting them all at my dream soirée. Here's who's invited:
