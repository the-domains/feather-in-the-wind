ABOUT ME ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9caeb9ea-70f4-47ac-b1ad-54d51babe674.jpg)

**Lusus Naturae.**

_"I am not an Athenian or a Greek, but a citizen of the world"._

Sport: Billiards

Arts: Marial

Book: Dictionary

★ **Idiosyncratic credo: ****Believe in the romantic. Learn of the mystic, the poetic, the artistic, the ecstatic. Live the fantastic. **★ 

My passions in life are traveling the world, practicing Kung-Fu, learning new languages, reading & haute couture. I study dictionaries and cookbooks for fun and I can actually taste the difference between good wines and the mediocre--- and not just be a snob about them. I spend about a month in Mykonos each summer & I try to travel to at least one other exotic destination every year. I love Paris (& Joel Robuchon) and I miss Venice, madly.
